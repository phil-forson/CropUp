            We may share your personal information in the following
            circumstances: With Service Providers: We may engage trusted
            third-party service providers to assist us in operating and
            maintaining the App. These providers have limited access to your
            personal information and are obligated to protect its
            confidentiality. For Legal Purposes: We may disclose your
            information if required by law, regulation, legal process, or
            governmental request, or when we believe in good faith that
            disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, enforce our policies,
            or address fraud or security issues. With Your Consent: We may share
            your information with your explicit consent or as otherwise
            disclosed at the time of data collection.
